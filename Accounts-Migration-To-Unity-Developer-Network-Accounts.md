# Accounts Migration To Unity Developer Network Accounts

As of October 1st 2015 you will need a Unity Developer Network (UDN) account to sign in to UnityAds.

If you had already registered to UDN with the same email address prior to ​September 8th 2015​ you are all set. Your old UnityAds/Everyplay GameAds account has been linked to your UDN account. You can proceed to sign in with your UDN account and continue using UnityAds.

If you did not have a UDN account prior to ​September 8th 2015​, we have migrated your old UnityAds/Everyplay GameAds account to UDN. You can sign in to UDN and UnityAds with the same email and password as before.
