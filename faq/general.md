#### Does Unity Ads support the Amazon Appstore or Amazon Marketplace?

No, Unity Ads does not currently support the Amazon App Store or Amazon Marketplace for downloadable Android Games.

You can implement Unity Ads in Android games downloaded through Amazon. However, all of our campaigns are currently advertising apps in the Google Play store. Ad impressions will not generate revenue unless the user also has access to the Google Play store.

We are exploring the possibility of expanding our network to include Amazon.
